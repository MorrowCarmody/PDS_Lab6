INSTRUCTIONS:
Part 2. Character Counts
This is a problem in the textbook, Problem 6.7, on page 235.
Write a Python script in a file named Lab6_Part2.py.
Recall that strings are sequences of characters. Use techniques similar to Fig. 6.2 to write a script that inputs
a sentence from the user, then uses a dictionary to summarize the number of occurrences of each letter.
Ignore case, ignore blanks and assume the user does not enter any punctuation. Display a two-column table
of the letters and their counts with the letters in sorted order.
